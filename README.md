# Back Into the Cave

Back Into the Cave was my entry to the forty-sixth Godot Wild Jam, where it took first place.

## Who made it?

The game - code, 3D models, music, sound effects, writing, et cetera - was made by John Gabriel (that's me - hi). Vocal performances were contributed by Jett Barker and Kameron Watson. Sekoia lent their talents as a playtester, and Vela helped me to sort out some rotation code to make the spaceship fly in the direction it's pointing.

## What can I do with this?

The game code is licensed under MIT, so you're free to use the code in your own work however you please. The assets, on the other hand, are copyrighted.
